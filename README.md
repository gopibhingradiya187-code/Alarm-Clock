Before opening a new issue, be sure to check the following:
- **Does the issue already exist?** Make sure a similar issue has not been reported by browsing [existing issues](https://github.com/gopibhingradiya187-code/Alarm-Clock/issues). Please search open and closed issues.
- **Is the issue still relevant?** Make sure your issue is not already fixed in the latest version of Clock.

- **Did you use the issue template?** It is important to make life of our kind contributors easier by avoiding issues that miss key information to their resolution.


## 💻 Code Contribution

### Getting Started

Clock project is based on Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin. To get started, you can install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), and import project 'from Version Control / Git / Github' by providing this git repository [URL](https://github.com/gopibhingradiya187-code/Alarm-Clock.git) (or git SSH URL).
Of course you can also use any other compatible IDE, or work with text editor and command line.

Once everything is up correctly, you're ready to go!

### Guidelines

Clock is a complex application, when contributing, you must take a step back and make sure your contribution:
- **Is actually wanted**. Best check related open issues before you start working on a PR. Issues with "help wanted" label are accepted, but still it would be good if you announced that you are working on it.
  If there is no issue related to your intended contribution, it's a good idea to open a new one to avoid disappointment of the contribution not being accepted. For small changes or fixing obvious bugs this step is not necessary.
- **Is only about a single thing**. Mixing unrelated contributions into a single PR is hard to review and can get messy.
- **Has a proper description**. What your contribution does is usually less obvious to reviewers than for yourself. A good description helps a lot for understanding what is going on, and for separating wanted from unintended changes in behavior.
- **Uses already in-place mechanism and take advantage of them**. In other terms, does not reinvent the wheel or uses shortcuts that could alter the consistency of the existing code.
- **Has a low footprint**. Some parts of the code are executed very frequently, and the keyboard should stay responsive even on older devices.
- **Does not bring any non-free code or proprietary binary blobs**. This also applies to code/binaries with unknown licenses. Make sure you do not introduce any closed-source library from Google.
  If your contribution contains code that is not your own, provide a link to the source.
- **Complies with the user privacy principle Clock follows**.

> **Note:** Please leave dependency upgrades to the maintainers, unless you state a good reason why they should be done now.
